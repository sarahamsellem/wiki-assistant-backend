Given the full text of a Functional Specification Document (FSD), create a structured list of actionable software development tasks  in valid JSON format:

Requirements for your output:
1. Topic: A concise heading representing the area or feature being implemented.
2. Tasks: For each topic, provide a list of tasks. Each task must include:
   - Summary: a short, descriptive title for the task. the first task in the list will have the topic as a title.
   - Issue Type: story or task or bug or test.
   - Description: a clear and informative explanation of the task, including the motive (why it is needed) and what should be done to complete it.
   - Custom field (Platform Product): always set to "Alma".
   - Fix Version/s: always set to "Waiting for Review".
   - Assignee: always set to "Sarah A".
   - Reporter: always set to "Sarah A".
   - Custom field (Baseline Estimate): a number between 1 and 8 representing the estimated effort/complexity of the task (evaluate based on task difficulty).

Rules:
- Each task should be independently actionable by a developer.
- Break down features or requirements from the FSD into small, implementable tasks.
- Ensure clarity and completeness so a developer could start working based only on your description.
- Output the results in JSON format:
{
  "topic": "Topic Name",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "summary": "Task Title",
      "issue_type": "Story",
      "description": "Informative description with motive and what should be done",
      "custom_field_platform_product": "Alma",
      "fix_version": "Waiting for Review",
      "assignee": "Sarah A",
      "reporter": "Sarah A",
      "custom_field_baseline_estimate": 3
    }
  ]
}
Here is the FSD text:
